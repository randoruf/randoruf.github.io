| ECE4094-ECE4095 Simulation-based Autonamous Parking System   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Motion planning for automated parking suggested by [Akansel Cosgun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HPPx6F8AAAAJ&hl=en). <br />The aim of this project is to deal with parking spot assignments in a smart parking lot. <br />There are a lot of academic publications focus on a single vehicle, but the parking problem involved with multi-agent has not been extensively studied yet. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust closed-loop goal assignment algorithm that is specified for automated valet parking scenarios. For now, the project is only at the very beginning phase... Hopefully, I will have time to solve the dynamic scenarios (e.g. vehicles can come in from the entrance or get out of the scene via the exit) in the future. <br />The project assumes the parking lot can percept the environment by using the sensors and automatically assign parking spots to incoming cars. <br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/prioritized_goal_example_presentation-20210530164736474.gif" alt="hello" style="zoom:80%;" /><br />**Duration**: March 2021 - June 2021 <br /> [![View Github](GitHub_Rep_brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/haohua-li/ece4095-parking-system-demo) |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ukkonen's algorithm is a linear-time, online algorithm for constructing suffix trees, proposed by Esko Ukkonen in 1995.<br />This implementaion includes all optimization tricks memtioned in *Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences* by *Dan Gusfield*.  <br />![image-20210828005352148](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/image-20210828005348029.png)<br />[![View Github](GitHub_Rep_brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/haohua-li/ukkonen-algorithm) |

| FIT3161-FIT3162 Heart Disease Prediction Web App             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using the data mining technique to capture the early signs of cardiovascular disease of their patients easily. <br />In the feature selection, *chi-square* and *point biserial correlation* were used. <br />The models (including SVM, KNN, ANN, Random Forest, GBM) were tuned by *Grid Search*. <br />React.js and Flask were used as the front-end and backend separately. <br />**Duration**: 2-3 months (Aug 2020).  -> [gallary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/FIT3161-heart-diease.html)<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/image-20201120222258275.png" alt="image-20200208003228574" style="zoom:40%;" /> |

| Winter Research Internship @ [tLab](https://sites.google.com/monash.edu/tlab/home) |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use the K-medoids, PCA/t-SNE, [HCTSA](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) and Multitaper Spectrogram to analyze the sleep data under the supervision of Naotsugu Tsuchiya. <br />**Duration**: 1 month (May 2020). <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/image-20210205142640664.png" alt="image-20210205142640664" style="zoom:100%;" /><br>[![View Github](GitHub_Rep_brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/haohua-li/tlab-intern-code-2019-2020/tree/master/tLab-2020-winter-research-sleep) |

| CSSR-Matlab                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A project attempts to port CSSR into Matlab during the summer research internship under the supervision of [Naotsugu Tsuchiya](https://sites.google.com/monash.edu/tlab/). <br />CSSR is an algorithm, developed by [Cosma Shalizi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/), can infer the epsilon transition (or epsilon machine) from an observed sequence. <br />Feeling interested? Read this **related resource** (Roberto N. Muñoz et.al.): <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13173><br /><br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/image-20201120225807816.png" style="zoom:40%;" /><br />[photo credit (Roberto N. Muñoz et.al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13173)<br />You may be familiar with C++ compilation and think of this project as nothing. But it can be easily incorporated into [HCTSA](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa) over any platform.<br />[![View CSSR-Matlab on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74604-cssr-matlab)<br /> |

| Use the CSSR algorithm (*epsilon machine* or *epsilon transition*) to measure the degree of consciousness by the statistical complexities under the supervision of Naotsugu Tsuchiya. <br />**Duration**: 3 months (Nov 2019).  <br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/image-20210205170700520.png" alt="image-20210205170700520" style="zoom:100%;" /><br>[![View Github](GitHub_Rep_brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/haohua-li/tlab-intern-code-2019-2020/tree/master/tLab-2019-summer-research-sleep) |

| ECE3091 Robot Building Competition                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| The aim of the project is to design and construct an autonomous robot that is able to navigate itself in a 1.2m x 1.2m arena, pick up three coloured pucks, and stack them one-by-one in a given sequence inside the construction zone of the arena. It mainly involves 1) navigation/path finding; 2) colour sensing; 3) manipulation of the pucks.  The knowledge involves PSoC, sensors, motors, schematics and CAD. <br />**Duration**: 2-3 months (Aug 2019).  -> [gallary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/ECE3091-robot.html)<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/image-20201120212551511.png" alt="image-20200208003228574" style="zoom:60%;" /> <a href="/images/princes_highway_clayton.jpg" style="color: #ebeeee"> <br />Princes Highway Clayton on 01/09/2019 - 生死之外无大事</a> |

| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developed in TypeScript, the Observable design pattern and functional reactive programming (FRP) were used.  It can be improved by [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview) in the future. <br />**Duration**: 1 month (Sep 2019).  ->  [play](/shared/website/asteroids_2019Assignment1/asteroids.html) <br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/image-20201120220742135.png" alt="image-20200208003228574" style="zoom:50%;" /> |

| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| A running app with features which calculate the running speed by tracking the distance travelled and the time taken for each run using the JavaScript (JQuery), Google Maps API and Material Design UI. It used *localstorage* to store the running records.<br />A similar web app that fetching weather forecasting is also developed in this unit. <br />**Duration**: 1 month (Feb 2017).  -> [gallary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/ENG1003-running-app.html)<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haohua-li/photo-asset-repo/main/imgs/image-20201120214537427.png" alt="image-20200208003228574" style="zoom:50%;" /> <br /><a href="https://maidragon.jp/" style="color: #ebeeee"> 小林さんちのメイドラゴン</a> |
