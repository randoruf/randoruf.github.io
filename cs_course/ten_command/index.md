## 对亚当说：「你必汗流满面才得糊口」

### [第27章：工作与个人的责任 (churchofjesuschrist.org)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-27-work-and-personal-responsibility?lang=zhs)

> The frightening disappearance of work as a part of our basic ethic is alarming. 
>
> We constantly hear the statements, **“It’s too hard,” “Give me something easier,” “I want it now,” “I can’t wait that long”** coming from our young people. 
>
> **The ugly disease of “nothing to do” is growing in epidemic proportions among us.** 
>
> It undermines the basic fabric of our nations. The prophet Ezekiel clearly defined iniquity as an **“abundance of idleness.”** (Ezek. 16:49.)

> ***Young men, are you spending too much time desiring what you want to be instead of establishing a course of discipline and working hard on what you are going to be?*** 
>
> 与其追求成为自己想要的人，不如建立一系列的原则和在将来的计划上努力。
>
> Sitting in a home one night with two of our missionaries, the challenge was issued to a young investigator to begin reading the Book of Mormon. His answer overwhelmed us as he sat in his recliner sipping from a twelve-ounce container from the corner convenience store. He said, “It’s too hard.”

> Brethren, using that as an analogy, cutting trees is more important than thinking about cutting trees or planning to cut trees. We are becoming the world experts in meeting, thinking, planning, and organizing about working the work, but we need to do it. We need to work.
>
> **砍树**比如去想砍树、或者计划砍树更加重要。**我们需要有人去工作**。
>
> While many are sitting and saying and even shouting great swelling words of marginal effectiveness, hard-working Latter-day Saints will always be found diligently doing and delivering potatoes to their neighbors. **Contrary to the belief of many, “Say” and “Sit” will never replace “Diligently Do.”** ***When you accept an assignment or commit to work for someone, work for them. Your integrity to that commitment will follow you throughout life. Any group of young men in any quorum knows who the workers are—those hallowed, quiet few who simply know how to get it done.*** 
>
> My young friends of the Aaronic Priesthood, ***say less and do more. Get it done.***  
>
> "说" 与 "坐" 从来不能期待 **"努力做"**。
>
> 当你从他人处接受了任务或者委托，***诚实地为他们工作***。你对承诺的诚实回伴随你的一生。
>
> 少说多做，做完它 。
>
> **いまやる、すぐやる、念願成就。**
>
> (面试官很看重**"交付能力"**，也就是 **Get It Done** 和 **成就** 的含义了。
>
> 或许很多人在 2016 年的时候想过在墨尔本做墨尔本送餐，但是只有少部分人去行动了，而且还强迫自己做完。)

- 不工作，休息与放松就失去了意义
- 六日要劳碌做你一切的工
- ***神告诉亚当，他需要终生工作，才能糊口***
