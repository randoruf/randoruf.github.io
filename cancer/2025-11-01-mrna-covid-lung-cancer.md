Administration of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of initiating ICI was associated with increased overall survival among patients with NSCLC (median OS 20.6 months vs. 37.3 months, three-year OS 30.6% vs 55.8%, adj HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-0.71, p < 0.0001) and metastatic melanoma (median OS 26.67 months vs unmet, 36-month OS 44.1% vs 67.5%, adj HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17-0.69, p=0.0029).


The new study involved records of 180 advanced lung cancer patients who received a COVID vaccine within a 100-day period before or after starting immunotherapy drugs and 704 treated with the same drugs who did not receive the vaccine. Getting the vaccine was associated with a near doubling of median survival, from 20.6 months to 37.3 months.
