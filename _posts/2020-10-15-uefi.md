这有助于你理解 UEFI 的原理

#### 载入 EFI 分区 (mount the EFI partion)

```
diskutil list
```

You should see something like this:

```
/dev/disk0
 #: TYPE                     NAME          SIZE       IDENTIFIER
 0: GUID_partition_scheme                  *251.0 GB  disk0
 1: EFI                                    209.7 MB   disk0s1
 2: Apple_HFS                Macintosh HD  250.1 GB   disk0s2
 3: Apple_Boot               Recovery HD   650.0 MB   disk0s3
```

Take note of `/dev/disk0` and `1: EFI`. The numbers `0` and `1` have significance later.

Now mount the EFI partition (replace the numbers `0` and `1` if they are different in your output):

```
sudo mkdir /Volumes/efi
sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi
```



#### 删除启动项 (Remove the Windows boot image)

Now navigate to `/Volumes/efi/EFI`. This directory is supposed to **only** contain an `APPLE` directory. 

On a machine where I had Windows installed, it also contained a `Microsoft` and `Boot` directory. These can be safely removed, *but for extra safety I would recommend renaming them to something different instead*.

```
rm -r BOOT
rm -r ubuntu
```

Then umount and delete the directory you created earlier.

```
sudo umount /Volumes/efi
sudo rmdir /Volumes/efi
```
