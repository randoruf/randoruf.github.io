Patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure of ≥26 mmHg were classi ed into the blood pressure elevation group, 
which showed a signi cantly lower mortality rate than that of the blood pressure non-elevation group (35.3% vs. 81.8%, log-rank p= 0.007), 
even after adjusting for age, sex, disease stage, performance status, and liver reserve function. 

This study demonstrated that patients who experienced earlier blood pressure elevation after lenvatinib administration had lower overall mortality rates. 

These ndings suggest that blood pressure elevations after lenvatinib initiation may serve as valuable prognostic indicators in patients with cancer undergoing lenvatinib therapy.
